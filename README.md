# wardrobe-shuffle

Android app, written in Kotlin, that tells you what to wear in the morning. Because who wants to think about what to wear?

*Under Construction*

You tell the app what your wardrobe is (one time), and it will use sophisticated logic to pick something out for you to wear any given day, in a way that increases variety and avoids wearing the same thing too often.

Actually, the main purpose of this app is to learn myself some Kotlin.
